# Introduction

Simple parser for [FASTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format) files used primarily as a hands-on learning project (meant to teach me a bit of Rust) and to help me solving bioinformatics challenges at [Rosalind](https://rosalind.info/).

# Disclaimer

This isn't suposed to be used or interpreted as a serious attempt at a well-developed Rust crate. See this as a toy project. If you need a better-supported and definetly more reliable Rust crate for dealing with biological sequences, try [rust-bio](https://docs.rs/bio/0.39.0/bio/index.html).
